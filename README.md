This is a simple platform that runs on Node + NextJS + Vercel. The styling is mainly provided by Tailwind CSS based on Creative Tim's Tailwind Starter Kit.

This platform will use a spreadsheet as its database so as to make a request to populate the custom user videos to the platform. All videos are sanitized to be displayed in the proper date. Every time a user requests data from the database, a time stamp is registered "check-in".
